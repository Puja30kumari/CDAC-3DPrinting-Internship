Tuning notes:
- Adjust STEPS_PER_MM_* for your mechanics (pulley diameter, belt pitch, gearing of 28BYJ-48).
- If motion is reversed, swap 'dir' sign or motor coil order.
- For smoother motion, reduce STEP_DELAY_US_BASE (at the cost of torque).
- Add endstops and homing if you extend beyond simple demos.
